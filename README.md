# Animal-Shelter-Analysis

i added to the google doc on which tasks i am currently working on

progress so far: 
  - the data_transformation.ipynb notebook takes the raw data (raw_data.csv), does feature transformations and outputs the transformed data as transformed_data.csv .
  - in the exploratory data analysis notbook there are some plots to visualize distributions and dependencies of the outcome on features.
