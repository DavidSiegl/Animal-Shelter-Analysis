## Our progress

I added to the google doc on which tasks I am currently working on

progress so far:

- the data_transformation.ipynb notebook takes the raw data (raw_data.csv), does feature transformations and outputs the
  transformed data as transformed_data.csv .
- in the exploratory data analysis notebook there are some plots to visualize distributions and dependencies of the
  outcome on features.
- added preliminary logistic regression model - but still needs improvement/more predictors
