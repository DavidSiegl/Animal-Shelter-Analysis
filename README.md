# Animal-Shelter-Analysis

## About the project
The data for the project was taken from an animal shelter in Austin. The main goal of the project was to extract relevant features of the animals which more likely lead to adoption in order to push ads for animals who happen to get adopted less frequently. Besides that we also focused our analysis on rarer animals in the shelter - i. e. animals who happen to display underpresented types of breed and/or colours - and collected some insights about the seasonal dependencies on animal adoptions.
